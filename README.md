For a list of changes implemented in this version, please view the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md).

**Due to significant improvements to data handling, users who took part in the version 1.0.1-beta or earlier are advised to create new accounts and restore their wallet seeds.**

An upgrade mechanism will be included in a future release to remove the requirement on the user to perform this step.

## Verifying authenticity of installer files
* It is highly recommended to verify the authenticty of the downloaded files before installing them by checking the PGP signatures. Alternatively you can verify the file integrity by calculating the checksums. You may do so by following the instructions provided [here](https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/Sphere_by_Horizen/blob/desktop-v1.19.0/VERIFY_AUTHENTICITY.md).

## Installation instructions

* All installers are available here [https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/Sphere_by_Horizen/releases/latest](https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/Sphere_by_Horizen/releases/latest)

* For Windows, download and run the .exe installer package and follow the standard windows installation procedure.

* For macOS, download and run the latest standard macOS package

  macOS packages have the ".dmg" file extension.

  Please install as you would any other non-app store macOS package by launching the file  (double click) and moving the app    to your Applications folder via the installer window.

* For Linux we supply both .deb packages for Debian systems and also a standalone AppImage to support other Linux based   distributions.

  ".deb" images can be opened and installed via a graphical package manager should you have one installed.

  You may also install via the terminal for example.
  ```
  $ sudo dpkg -i example_file_name.deb
  ```
  AppImage files are self-contained and can be launched by firstly making the AppImage file executable via
  ```
  $ chmod a+x example_file_name*.AppImage
  ```
  And then run
  ```
  $ ./example_file_name*.AppImage
  ```
